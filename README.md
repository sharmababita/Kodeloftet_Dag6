Being a web developer is really about having a holistic perspective on websites, where both design and functionality come into play. Content, location, functionality and colors are all central elements that together create a good user experience. When we develop websites, we must always have the users' needs in mind, so that the page is both intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.

When we plan a design or website layout, it is important to create a "common thread" that ties the page together. By taking inspiration from other websites, we get ideas for what works well and what can be improved. We can further develop and adapt this inspiration to create something unique that suits our specific project.

By creating wireframes in Figma, we get a visual overview of the structure and layout of the website before we start the actual coding. This can save us a lot of time, as we already have a detailed plan for the design. Wireframes make it possible to experiment with different layout choices and get feedback at an early stage, which increases the chance that the final product will be both functionally and visually satisfying. With a clear wireframe design, we know exactly where the elements should be placed, and we have a structure we can follow when we start coding.

The purpose of learning how to create wireframes in Figma is to gain a better understanding of how we can structure a website, and how we can map which HTML elements and CSS properties we need to achieve this design. A good wireframe acts as a road map, which helps us stay focused on the user  experience and ensures that all functions and visual elements are well thought out. This basis means that we can go directly from design to code with a clear plan, which gives a better and more complete end result.

**Task description:**

Create a simple wireframe for a website. The wireframe should represent an overview of the content and show where the various elements are placed on the page. The wireframe must contain different sections for header, main and footer. In the header, you should consider elements such as logo, navigation menu and possible search function. The main section (main) must contain content areas that are relevant to the website, such as an introduction section, image area or article. Use what you have learned in the lesson on design principles to create a layout that meets the requirements.

**Claim**:

Create wireframe for a website in desktop (Select frames -> desktop -> desktop)
Set up a header that has a navigation
Set up main which has different sections of content
Set up a footer that has credit

**Bonus:**

Create wireframe for the same website as desktop but for mobile size (Choose frames -> mobile -> iphone/android)

Instead of using boxes that illustrate content, add text and images to the design instead.
